Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals
Artificial intelligence refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine perception enables AI systems to interpret sensory data from cameras, microphones, and sensors. Decision-making algorithms analyze information and select optimal actions based on learned knowledge. Natural language understanding allows AI to comprehend human communication and respond appropriately in context.
